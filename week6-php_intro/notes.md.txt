## Installation
On windows, install XAMPP portable lite .zip -> trouble with install version
Place extracted xampp folder into root C drive

Where you will be placing files is in htdocs
Click on xampp_start.exe to open console and start server, don't forget to run xampp_stop.exe to stop server

go to localhost to see what's going on
## Make your own directory
inside htdocs, create the php_into directory, add demo1.php
go to localhost/php_intro/demo1 to see page

## PHP
'superglobals' ie. $_GET
get request appents formdata to url, ie. localhost/file.php?name=value&name=value

In request, header has info about request, body has the data you are sending
In response, header has info about whether request successful, body contains returned data (html)

You can only modify header once you've had output
	- put header modification above the html tag

make sure you use localhost and not file protocol in browser
in Chrome, go to inspect element, go to Network tab, you can see headers
200 - server error, 500 - php error, 400 - page not found

good idea to declare functions at the top of the process file, before any output
no semicolon needed at end of functino declaration

to include the contents of another file: require('$local_file') - page fails to load if require not met
import('$local_file') - warning, but no error if import doesn't happen
